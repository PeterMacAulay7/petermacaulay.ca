            <li>Just updated the page to use the index.php file as a directory for all other pages. 
              It took a lot longer than expected. &#40I guess thats to be expected&#41</li>
            <li>Currently learning HTML/CSS/PHP</li>
            <li>I have big plans for taking the dev side of this website to a new level;
              you may not see all of it as a visitor, I will have a blog post or project update when I'm done.
              Mostly because those are the types of pages that will be possible with my plans.
